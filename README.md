Linux at a high APM

## Introduction

IdrA is an experimental Linux distribution intended for use in
[wasmcloud](https://christine.website/blog/wasmcloud-progress-2019-12-08). It is
currently very small and is intended to run in
[firecracker](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/) and will probably never
work on hardware.

All packages in `./pkgs` are built using [Nix](https://nixos.org/)
